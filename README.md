# ChineseGuesser
This is a short game I made in Unity for Android. Consists in a guessing game of the combination of two Kanjis.

I wanted to present in an entertaining way something I learnt in my two years of chinese learning.
There are some, so to speak, basic words, which combined turn into another meaning, but still these new words contain some essence of the two words, that makes them very interesting. 

The goal of the game is to try to guess the meaning of the word combination in less than 15 seconds, whereas an image, representing the meaning, gets unblurred.
